# Scraping Toy Cars with python.
The goal of this project is to extract cars information from the wellydiecast to create a clean dataset which can be use for Data Analysis in the future. 
This project is for Experienced scraper, who can contribute to improve the code in the project.






# Dependencies

1. Python3 version_3.9 above.
2. BeautifulSoup
3. aiohttp
4. Pandas
5. Asyncio
### Python3
Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.
### Aiohttp
Aiohttp which is an HTTP client/server for asyncio. Basically, it allows you to write asynchronous clients and servers.
### BeautifulSoup
Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping.
### Pandas
pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license.
### Asyncio
Asyncio is a library to write concurrent code using the async/await syntax. asyncio is used as a foundation for multiple Python asynchronous frameworks that provide high-performance network and web-servers, database connection libraries, distributed task queues, etc.
